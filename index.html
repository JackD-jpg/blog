    <div class="post-content">
      <p>If today is Tuesday, then tomorrow is Wednesday. If tomorrow is Wednesday, then I am done (just kidding). Recently I have prepared for my big day and hopefully there will be not any mistake (well should be because I have prepared for this much of the time).  Anyway, I need to be careful as best as I can. I am ready !~  </p>

    <h3 class="post-title"> Another good advice </h3>
    <div class="post-content">
      <p>  To be an developer you don't have to be an expert. What is important is your passion for technology and for community. That is, hoping to make a difference in the world is my desirable achievement. Of course, at the present I am not able to that. It will happen soon. </p></div>

    <div class="post-content">
      <p>If somebody would have told me a week ago that I would be able to make a website, I would not have believed them. But just a few days before, I began making an <strong>actual</strong> blog. As saying this post is the first post that I have. Writing blog will be my habit from now on !</p></div>
